Jurisdiction exists in the Superior Court of the State of California pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 410.10. 19. Venue is proper in Los Angeles County, California pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 392, et seq. because, among other things, Los Angeles County is where the causes of action complained of herein arose; the county in which the employment relationship began; the county in which performance of the employment contract, or part of it, between Plaintiff and Defendants was due to be performed; the county in which the employment contract, or part of it, between Plaintiff and Defendants was actually performed; and the county in which Defendants, or some of them, reside. Moreover, the unlawful acts alleged herein have a direct effect on Plaintiff and Class Members in Los Angeles County, and because Defendants employ numerous Class Members in Los Angeles County. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 20. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to pay overtime wages to Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, in violation of California state wage and hour laws as a result of, without limitation, Plaintiff and Class Members working over eight (8) hours per day, forty (40) hours per week, and seven consecutive work days in a work week without being properly compensated for hours worked in excess of (8) hours per day in a work day, forty (40) hours per week in a work week, and/or hours worked on the seventh consecutive work day in a work week by, among other things, failing to accurately track and/or pay for all minutes actually worked at the proper overtime rate of pay; engaging, suffering, or permitting employees to work off the clock, including, without limitation, by requiring Plaintiff and Class Members: to clock out for meal periods and continue working; and failing to include all forms of remuneration, including non-discretionary bonuses, incentive pay, meal allowances, mask allowances, gift cards and other forms of remuneration into the regular rate of pay for the pay periods where overtime was worked and the additional compensation was earned for the purpose of calculating the overtime rate of pay to the detriment of Plaintiff and Class Members. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 7 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 21. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this Action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to pay minimum wages to Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, in violation of California state wage and hour laws as a result of, among other things, at times, failing to accurately track and/or pay for all hours actually worked at their regular rate of pay that is above the minimum wage; engaging, suffering, or permitting employees to work off the clock, including, without limitation, by requiring Plaintiff and Class Members: to clock out for meal periods and continue working to the detriment of Plaintiff and Class Members. 22. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this Action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to provide Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, full, timely thirty (30) minute uninterrupted meal period for days on which they worked more than five (5) hours in a work day and a second thirty (30) minute uninterrupted meal period for days on which they worked in excess of ten (10) hours in a work day, and failing to provide compensation for such unprovided meal periods as required by California wage and hour laws. 23. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to authorize and permit Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, to take rest periods of at least ten (10) minutes per four (4) hours worked or major fraction thereof and failed to provide compensation for such unprovided rest periods as required by California wage and hour laws. 24. For at least three (3) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to pay Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, the full amount of their wages owed to them upon termination and/or resignation as required by Labor Code sections 201 and 202, including for, without limitation, failing to pay overtime wages, minimum wages, and premium wages, and vacation pay pursuant to Labor Code section 227.3. 25. For at least one (1) year prior to the filing of this Action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to furnish Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, with itemized wage statements that accurately reflect gross wages earned; total hours worked; net wages earned; all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate; and other such information as required by Labor Code section 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 8 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 226, subdivision (a). As a result thereof, Defendants have further failed to furnish employees with an accurate calculation of gross and gross wages earned, as well as gross and net wages paid. 26. For at least one (1) year prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to pay Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, the full amount of their wages for labor performed in a timely fashion as required under Labor Code section 204. 27. For at least three (3) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have, at times, failed to indemnify Class Members, or some of them, for the costs incurred in purchasing and/or providing unreturned deposits for mandatory work uniforms; laundering mandatory work uniforms; mileage and/or gas costs incurred in driving personal vehicles for work-related purposes; using cellular phones for work-related purposes; and purchasing tools necessary to perform work duties. 28. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have had a consistent policy of failing to provide Plaintiff and similarly situated employees or former employees within the State of California with compensation at their final rate of pay for unused vested paid vacation days pursuant to Labor Code section 227.3. 29. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have had a consistent policy of failing to provide Plaintiffs and similarly situated employees or former employees within the State of California with the rights provided to them under the Healthy Workplace Heathy Families Act of 2014, codified at Labor Code section 245, et seq. 30. Plaintiff, on their own behalf and on behalf of Class Members, brings this action pursuant to, including but not limited to, Labor Code sections 200, 201, 202, 203 , 226, 226.7, 227.3, 245, et seq., 510, 512, 558.1, 1194, 1194.2, 1197, 2802, and California Code of Regulations, Title 8, section 11040, seeking overtime wages, minimum wages, payment of premium wages for missed meal and rest periods, failure to pay timely wages, waiting time penalties, wage statement penalties, failure to indemnify work-related expenses, failing to pay vested vacation time at the proper rate of pay, other such provisions of California law, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 9 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 31. Plaintiff, on Plaintiff’s own behalf and on behalf of Class Members, pursuant to Business and Professions Code sections 17200 through 17208, also seeks (an) injunction(s) prohibiting Defendants from further violating the Labor Code and requiring the establishment of appropriate and effective means to prevent further violations, as well as all monies owed but withheld and retained by Defendants to which Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled, as well as restitution of amounts owed. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS 32. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of Plaintiff and Class Members as a class action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 382. Plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all current and former non-exempt employees of Defendants within the State of California at any time commencing four (4) years preceding the filing of Plaintiff’s complaint up until the time that notice of the class action is provided to the class (collectively referred to as “Class Members”). 33. Plaintiff reserves the right under California Rule of Court rule 3.765, subdivision (b) to amend or modify the class description with greater specificity, further divide the defined class into subclasses, and to further specify or limit the issues for which certification is sought. 34. This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a class action under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 382 because there is a well-defined community of interest in the litigation and the proposed Class is easily ascertainable. A. Numerosity 35. The potential Class Members as defined are so numerous that joinder of all the members of the Class is impracticable. While the precise number of Class Members has not been determined yet, Plaintiff is informed and believes that there are over seventy-five (75) Class Members employed by Defendants within the State of California. 36. Accounting for employee turnover during the relevant periods necessarily increases this number. Plaintiff alleges Defendants’ employment records would provide information as to the number and location of all Class Members. Joinder of all members of the proposed Class is not practicable. /// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 10 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT B. Commonality 37. There are questions of law and fact common to Class Members. These common questions include, but are not limited to: A. Did Defendants violate Labor Code sections 510 and 1194 by failing to pay all hours worked at a proper overtime rate of pay? B. Did Defendants violate Labor Code sections 510, 1194 and 1197 by failing to pay for all other time worked at the employee’s regular rate of pay and a rate of pay that is greater than the applicable minimum wage? C. Did Defendants violate Labor Code section 512 by not authorizing or permitting Class Members to take compliant meal periods? D. Did Defendants violate Labor Code section 226.7 by not providing Class Members with additional wages for missed or interrupted meal periods? E. Did Defendants violate applicable Wage Orders by not authorizing or permitting Class Members to take compliant rest periods? F. Did Defendants violate Labor Code section 226.7 by not providing Class Members with additional wages for missed rest periods? G. Did Defendants violate Labor Code sections 201 and 202 by failing to pay Class Members upon termination or resignation all wages earned? H. Are Defendants liable to Class Members for waiting time penalties under Labor Code section 203? I. Did Defendants violate Labor Code section 226, subdivision (a) by not furnishing Class Members with accurate wage statements? J. Did Defendants fail to pay Class Members in a timely fashion as required under Labor Code section 204? K. Did Defendants fail to indemnify Class Members for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties or by obedience to the directions of Defendants as required under Labor Code section 2802? / / / 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 11 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT L. Did Defendants violate Labor Code section 227.3 by not providing Class Members with compensation at their final rate of pay for vested paid vacation time? M. Did Defendants violate the Unfair Competition Law, Business and Professions Code section 17200, et seq., by their unlawful practices as alleged herein? N. Are Class Members entitled to restitution of wages under Business and Professions Code section 17203? O. Are Class Members entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees? P. Are Class Members entitled to interest? C. Typicality 38. The claims of Plaintiff herein alleged are typical of those claims which could be alleged by any Class Members, and the relief sought is typical of the relief which would be sought by each Class Member in separate actions. Plaintiff and Class Members sustained injuries and damages arising out of and caused by Defendants’ common course of conduct in violation of laws and regulations that have the force and effect of law and statutes as alleged herein. D. Adequacy of Representation 39. Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interest of Class Members. Counsel who represents Plaintiff is competent and experienced in litigating wage and hour class actions. E. Superiority of Class Action 40. A class action is superior to other available means for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. Individual joinder of all Class Members is not practicable, and questions of law and fact common to Class Members predominate over any questions affecting only individual Class Members. Class Members, as further described therein, have been damaged and are entitled to recovery by reason of Defendants’ policies and/or practices that have resulted in the violation of the Labor Code at times, as set out herein. 41. Class action treatment will allow Class Members to litigate their claims in a manner that is most efficient and economical for the parties and the judicial system. Plaintiff is unaware of any difficulties that are likely to be encountered in the management of this action that would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 12 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT preclude its maintenance as a class action. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Pay Overtime Wages – Against All Defendants) 42. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 43. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code sections 510, 1194 and 1199, as well as applicable Wage Orders. 44. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Labor Code section 510 was in effect and provided: “(a) Eight hours of labor constitutes a day’s work. Any work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of forty hours in any one workweek . . . shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for an employee.” 45. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Labor Code section 510 further provided that “[a]ny work in excess of 12 hours in one day shall be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the regular rate of pay for an employee. In addition, any work in excess of eight hours on any seventh day of a workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than twice the regular rate of pay.” 46. Four (4) years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Plaintiff and Class Members, at times, worked for Defendants during shifts that consisted of more than eight (8) hours in a workday and/or more than forty hours in a workweek, and/or seven (7) consecutive workdays in a workweek, without being paid overtime wages for all hours worked as a result of, including but not limited to, Defendants failing to accurately track and/or pay for all hours actually worked at the proper overtime rate of pay; engaging, suffering, or permitting employees to work off the clock, including, without limitation, by requiring Plaintiff and Class Members: to clock out for meal periods and continue working and failing to include all forms of remuneration, including non-discretionary bonuses, incentive pay, meal allowances, mask allowances, gift cards and other forms of remuneration into the regular rate of pay for the pay periods where overtime was worked and the additional compensation was earned for the purpose of calculating the overtime rate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 13 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT of pay to the detriment of Plaintiff and Class Members. 47. Accordingly, by requiring Plaintiff and Class Members to, at times, work greater than eight (8) hours per workday, forty (40) hours per workweek, and/or seven (7) straight workdays without properly compensating overtime wages at the proper overtime rate of pay, Defendants, on occasion, willfully violated the provisions of the Labor Code, among others, sections 510, 1194, and applicable IWC Wage Orders, and California law. 48. As a result of the unlawful acts of Defendants, Plaintiff and Class Members have been deprived of overtime wages in amounts to be determined at trial, and are entitled to recovery, plus interest and penalties thereon, attorneys’ fees and costs, pursuant to Labor Code section 1194 and 1199, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Pay Minimum Wages – Against All Defendants) 49. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 50. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code sections 1197, 1199 and applicable Wage Orders. 51. Pursuant to Labor Code section 1197 and applicable Wage Orders, Plaintiff and Class Members were entitled to receive minimum wages for all hours worked or otherwise under Defendants’ control. 52. For four (4) years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Defendants failed, at times, to accurately track and/or pay for all hours actually worked at their regular rate of pay that is above the minimum wage and engaged, suffered, or permitted employees to work off the clock, including, without limitation, by requiring Plaintiff and Class Members: to clock out for meal periods and continue working to the detriment of Plaintiff and Class Members. 53. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered damages in an amount, subject to proof, to the extent they were not paid minimum wages for all hours worked or otherwise due. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 14 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 54. Pursuant to Labor Code sections 218.6, 1194, 1194.2, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover the full amount of unpaid minimum wages, interest and penalties thereon, liquidated damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Provide Meal Periods – Against All Defendants) 55. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 56. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code section 512 and applicable Wage Orders. 57. Pursuant to Labor Code section 512 and applicable Wage Orders, no employer shall employ an employee for a work period of more than five (5) hours without a timely meal break of not less than thirty (30) minutes in which the employee is relieved of all of his or her duties. Furthermore, no employer shall employ an employee for a work period of more than ten (10) hours per day without providing the employee with a second timely meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes in which the employee is relieved of all of his or her duties. 58. Pursuant to Labor Code section 226.7, if an employer fails to provide an employee with a meal period as provided in the applicable Wage Order of the Industrial Welfare Commission, the employer shall pay the employee one (1) additional hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate of compensation for each workday that the meal period is not provided. 59. For four (4) years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Plaintiff and Class Members were, at times, not provided complete, timely 30-minute, duty- free uninterrupted meal periods every five hours of work without waiving the right to take them, as permitted. Moreover, at times, Defendants failed to provide one (1) additional hour of pay at the Class Member’s regular rate of compensation on the occasions that Class Members were not provided compliant meal periods. 60. By their failure to provide Plaintiff and Class Members compliant meal periods as contemplated by Labor Code section 512, among other California authorities, and failing, at times, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 15 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT to provide compensation for such unprovided meal periods, as alleged above, Defendants willfully violated the provisions of Labor Code section 512 and applicable Wage Orders. 61. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered damages in an amount, subject to proof, to the extent they were not paid additional pay owed for missed, untimely, interrupted, incomplete and/or on-duty meal periods. 62. Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover the full amount of their unpaid additional pay for unprovided compliant meal periods, in amounts to be determined at trial, plus interest and penalties thereon, attorneys’ fees, and costs, under Labor Code sections 226 and 226.7, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Provide Rest Periods – Against All Defendants) 63. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 64. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by applicable Wage Orders. 65. California law and applicable Wage Orders require that employers “authorize and permit” employees to take ten (10) minute rest periods in about the middle of each four (4) hour work period “or major fraction thereof.” Accordingly, employees who work shifts of three and-a- half (3 ½) to six (6) hours must be provided ten (10) minutes of paid rest period, employees who work shifts of more than six (6) and up to ten (10) hours must be provided with twenty (20) minutes of paid rest period, and employees who work shifts of more than ten (10) hours must be provided thirty (30) minutes of paid rest period. 66. Pursuant to Labor Code section 226.7, if an employer fails to provide an employee with a meal period or rest period as provided in the applicable Wage Order of the Industrial Welfare Commission, the employer shall pay the employee one (1) additional hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate of compensation for each work day that the rest period is not provided. 67. For four (4) years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Plaintiff and Class Members were, at times, not authorized or permitted to take complete, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 16 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT timely 10-minute, duty-free uninterrupted rest periods every four (4) hours of work or major fraction thereof. Moreover, at times, Defendants failed to provide one (1) additional hour of pay at the Class Member’s regular rate of compensation on the occasions that Class Members were not authorized or permitted to take compliant rest periods. 68. By their failure, at times, to authorize and permit Plaintiff and Class Members to take rest periods contemplated by California law, and one (1) additional hour of pay at the employee’s regular rate of compensation for such unprovided rest periods, as alleged above, Defendants willfully violated the provisions of Labor Code section 226.7 and applicable Wage Orders. 69. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered damages in an amount, subject to proof, to the extent they were not paid additional pay owed for rest periods that they were not authorized or permitted to take. 70. Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover the full amount of their unpaid additional pay for unprovided compliant rest periods, in amounts to be determined at trial, plus interest and penalties thereon, attorneys’ fees, and costs, under Labor Code sections 226 and 226.7, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287. FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Pay All Wages Due Upon Termination – Against All Defendants) 71. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 72. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code sections 201, 202 and 203, as well as applicable Wage Orders. 73. Pursuant to Labor Code sections 201 and 202, Plaintiff and Class Members were entitled upon termination to timely payment of all wages earned and unpaid prior to termination. Discharged Class Members were entitled to payment of all wages earned and unpaid prior to discharge immediately upon termination. Class Members who resigned were entitled to payment of all wages earned and unpaid prior to resignation within 72 hours after giving notice of resignation or, if they gave 72 hours previous notice, they were entitled to payment of all wages earned and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 17 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT unpaid at the time of resignation. 74. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in the three (3) years before the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Defendants, due to the failure, at times, to provide overtime wages mentioned above, failed to pay Plaintiff and Class Members all wages earned prior to resignation or termination in accordance with Labor Code sections 201 or 202. 75. Plaintiff is informed and believes Defendants’ failure, at times, to pay Plaintiff and Class Members all wages earned prior to termination or resignation in accordance with Labor Code sections 201 and 202 was willful. Defendants had the ability to pay all wages earned by Plaintiff and Class Members at the time of termination in accordance with Labor Code sections 201 and 202, but intentionally adopted policies or practices incompatible with the requirements of Labor Code sections 201 and 202 resulting in the failure, at times, to pay all wages earned prior to termination or resignation. 76. Pursuant to Labor Code section 203, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to waiting time penalties from the date their earned and unpaid wages were due, upon termination or resignation, until paid, up to a maximum of thirty (30) days. 77. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered damages in an amount subject to proof, to the extent they were not paid for all wages earned prior to termination or resignation. 78. Pursuant to Labor Code section 203 and 218.6, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover waiting time penalties, interest, and their costs of suit, as well. SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Provide Accurate Wage Statements – Against All Defendants) 79. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 80. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code section 226, as well as applicable Wage Orders. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 18 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 81. Pursuant to Labor Code section 226, subdivision (a), Plaintiff and Class Members were entitled to receive, semi-monthly or at the time of each payment of wages, an accurate itemized statement that accurately reflects, among other things, gross wages earned; total hours worked; net wages earned; and all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate, among other things. 82. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in the one (1) year before the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Defendants failed to comply with Labor Code section 226, subdivision (a) by adopting policies and practices that resulted in their failure, at times, to furnish Plaintiff and Class Members with accurate itemized statements that accurately reflect, among other things, gross wages earned; total hours worked; net wages earned; and all applicable hourly rates in effect during the pay period and the corresponding number of hours worked at each hourly rate, among other things. 83. Defendants’ failure to, at times, provide Plaintiff and Class Members with accurate wage statements was knowing, intentional, and willful. Defendants had the ability to provide Plaintiff and the other Class Members with accurate wage statements, but, at times, willfully provided wage statements that Defendants knew were not accurate. 84. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered injury. The absence of accurate information on Class Members’ wage statements at times has delayed timely challenge to Defendants’ unlawful pay practices; requires discovery and mathematical computations to determine the amount of wages owed; causes difficulty and expense in attempting to reconstruct time and pay records; and led to submission of inaccurate information about wages and amounts deducted from wages to state and federal governmental agencies, among other things. 85. Pursuant to Labor Code section 226, subdivision (e), Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover $50 for the initial pay period during the period in which violation of Labor Code section 226 occurred and $100 for each violation of Labor Code section 226 in a subsequent pay period, not to exceed an aggregate $4,000.00 per employee. 86. Pursuant to Labor Code sections 226, subdivisions (e) and (g), Code of Civil 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 19 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Procedure section 1032, Civil Code section 3287, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover the full amount of penalties due under Labor Code section 226, subdivision (e), reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs of suit. SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Failure to Timely Pay Wages During Employment – Against All Defendants) 87. Plaintiff realleges each and every allegation set forth in the preceding paragraphs and incorporate each by reference as though fully set forth hereat. 88. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code section 204 and applicable Wage Orders. 89. Labor Code section 204 provides that “[l]abor performed between the 1st and 15th days, inclusive, of any calendar month shall be paid for between the 16 th and 26th day of the month during which the labor was performed, and labor performed between the 16th and the last day, inclusive, of any calendar month, shall be paid for between the 1st and 10th day of the following month.” 90. Labor Code section 210, subdivision (a) states that “[i]n addition to, and entirely independent and apart from, any other penalty provided in this article, every person who fails to pay the wages of each employee as provided in Sections 201.3, 204, 204b, 204.1, 204.2, 205, 205.5, and 1197.5, shall be subject to a civil penalty as follows: (1) For any initial violation, one hundred dollars ($100) for each failure to pay each employee” and “(2) For each subsequent violation, or any willful or intentional violation, two hundred dollars ($200) for each failure to pay each employee, plus 25 percent of the amount unlawfully withheld.” 91. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in the one (1) year before the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Defendants employed policies and practices that resulted in, at times, not paying Plaintiff and Class Members in accordance with Labor Code section 204. 92. Pursuant to Labor Code section 210, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover penalties for Defendants’ violations of Labor Code section 204, in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100) for each initial violation per Class Member, and two hundred dollars ($200) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 20 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT for each subsequent violation in connection with each payment that was made in violation of Labor Code section 204 per Class Member, plus 25 percent of the amount unlawfully withheld. 93. Pursuant to Labor Code section 218.6, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recovery of penalties, interest, and their costs of suit, as well. EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of Labor Code § 2802 – Against All Defendants) 94. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 95. At all relevant times, Plaintiff and Class Members were employees or former employees of Defendants covered by Labor Code section 2802 and applicable Wage Orders. 96. Labor Code section 2802, subdivision (a) provides that “an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties . . .” 97. For three (3) years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this Action through the present, Defendants required Plaintiff and Class Members, or some of them, to incur, at times, necessary expenditures or losses in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties or at the obedience to the directions of Defendants. 98. During that time period, Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that Defendants failed and refused, and still fail and refuse, at times, to reimburse Plaintiff sand Class Members for those losses and/or expenditures. 99. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered damages in an amount subject to proof, to the extent they were not reimbursed for the herein-described losses and/or expenditures. 100. Pursuant to Labor Code section 2802, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1032, and Civil Code section 3287, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover reimbursement for their herein-described losses and/or expenditures, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 21 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of Labor Code § 227.3 – Against All Defendants 101. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as though fully set forth hereon. 102. According to Labor Code section 227.3, whenever a contract of employment or employer policy provides for paid vacations, and an employee is terminated without having taken off his vested vacation time, all vested vacation shall be paid to him as wages at his final rate in accordance with such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served. 103. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges that, at all times relevant hereto, Defendants promulgated and maintained a uniform policy providing for paid vacations, and that Plaintiff’s employment contract with Defendants included paid vacations. 104. For at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have had a consistent policy of failing to provide Plaintiff and similarly situated employees or former employees within the State of California with compensation at their final rate of pay for unused vested paid vacation days pursuant to Labor Code section 227.3. 105. As a proximate result of Defendants’ failure to pay vested vacation at the final rate of Plaintiff and Class Members upon their resignation or termination, Defendants violated Labor Code section 227.3, entitling Plaintiff and Class Members to all vested and unused vacation pay at their final rate of pay, as set out in Defendants’ policy or the contract of employment between Plaintiff and Class Members, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the other hand. 106. As a further proximate result of Defendants’ above-described acts and/or omissions, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs of suit and prejudgment interest. TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Unfair Competition – Against All Defendants) 107. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 22 CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT 108. Plaintiff is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that the unlawful conduct of Defendants alleged herein constitutes unfair competition within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 17200. Plaintiff is further informed and believes and based thereon alleges that in addition to the unlawful conduct of Defendants alleged in the preceding paragraphs, for at least four (4) years prior to the filing of this action and continuing to the present, Defendants have had a consistent policy of failing to provide Plaintiff and similarly situated employees or former employees within the State of California with the rights provided to them under the Healthy Workplace Heathy Families Act of 2014, codified at Labor Code section 245, et seq. Due to their unlawful business practices in violation of the Labor Code, Defendants have gained a competitive advantage over other comparable companies doing business in the State of California that comply with their obligations to compensate employees in accordance with the Labor Code. 109. As a result of Defendants’ unfair competition as alleged herein, Plaintiff and Class Members have suffered injury in fact and lost money or property. 110. Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 17203, Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to (an) injunction(s) prohibiting Defendants from further violating the Labor Code and requiring the establishment of appropriate and effective means to prevent further violations, as well as restitution of all wages and other monies owed to them under the Labor Code, including interest thereon, in which they had a property interest and which Defendants nevertheless failed to pay them and instead withheld and retained for themselves. Restitution of the money owed to Plaintiff and Class Members is necessary to prevent Defendants from becoming unjustly enriched by their failure to comply with the Labor Code. 111. Plaintiff and Class Members are entitled to costs of suit under Code of Civil Procedure section 1032 and interest under Civil Code section 3287. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 112. Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all causes of action contained herein.
