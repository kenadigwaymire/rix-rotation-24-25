Abstract Modern trends are driving spacecraft to the extremes of length scales. On the one hand, the ubiquitous trend toward miniaturization is pushing spacecraft ever smaller; one the other hand, many commercial, military, and science applications can only be done with very large systems. In either case, ultra-lightweight or gossamer technology will enable a future generation of spacecraft that have remarkable capability to accomplish missions beyond the reach of current systems. In this chapter we discuss the technology, and the challenges and opportunities, of gossamer spacecraft. 1 Technology background 1.1 Overview of gossamer spacecraft technology Recent technological advancements in structural analysis materials, fabrication, and testing, have presented the space community with a low-cost, lightweight alternative to mechanically deployed space structures. These gossamer spacecraft have many benefits and advantages over current mechanical systems. They are low in mass and can be packaged into small volumes, which can potentially reduce the overall program cost by reducing the launch-vehicle size. Reduction in total system mass and deployment complexity can also increase system reliability. They are of particular advantage for mission architectures at the extreme ends of the size spectrum—from the very small to the very large. To be clear, gossamer spacecraft are typically realized as membrane structures. We mean by membrane structures those structures (load-carrying artifacts or devices) comprised of highly flexible (compliant) plate or shell-like elements. This usually implies thin, low-modulus materials, such as polymer films. Membrane structures have very little inherent stiffness, and do not lend themselves well to carrying compressive loads. Thus, they are often found either in www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press doi:10.2495/978-1-85312-941-4/10 204 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering tensioned-planar or inflated-curved configurations. In what follows, we will use the terms membrane, inflatable, and membrane/inflatable interchangeably. There is great interest in compliant structures by near-term space missions, and a possibility of enabling several breakthrough missions in the more distant future [1–20]. Membrane structures are envisioned for such applications as deep space antennas, earth radiometers, radars, concentrators, telescopes, sun shields, solar sails, solar arrays, and spacecraft booms. In 1997 NASA embarked on a technology development program to advance gossamer spacecraft technology and make it available to 21 st century space missions. NASA has concentrated on such areas as deployment techniques, membrane and rigidizable materials, and analytical tool development. It is hoped this will accelerate technology development in the areas of large ultra-light apertures and solar sails, for example, which are among the most challenging applications of membrane structures. The analytical simulation of mechanical performance of compliant space structures is absolutely essential to support the development of technology and projection of performance for this new class of space structures. There are a number of elements of this technology that must be understood analytically to develop and apply this technology. In addition to the modeling needed to characterize the structural dynamics of the on-orbit configurations, highly specialized approaches are needed to simulate other specific mechanical events and structural relationships. Such specialized capability should include simulation of a) specific control deployment techniques for structural members, b) generic spatially organized and controlled deployment processes, c) identification and application of scaling laws to enable the use of limited test results to project full-scale mechanical performance, and d) deflection characteristics of thin membranes under tension and loaded by differential pressure, among many others. There are currently a number of different techniques for control of the deployment of gossamer structural elements. The most promising techniques currently under development have been simulated and will be verified experimentally with scaled hardware. New and unique techniques for spatially controlling deployment through the management of a number of discrete masses have been developed. The potential benefits of this process have been identified. Scaling laws for this new class of space structures have been developed. They have been applied to the test results of scaled hardware to show the relationship with full-scale structures. The basic equations have been developed to determine the deflection characteristics of a tensioned membrane under differential pressure loading. This characterization will be modified to include segmented membranes and the stiffness effects of their seams. This will enable the development of an error budget for precision inflatable reflector structures. And what is the future of membrane structures in the new millennium? It can be summarized with just two words – gossamer spacecraft. “Technology to find it and then shake its hand” is a long-term vision. This somewhat humorous sounding motto appears even more outrageous when translated into scientific terms. NASA will develop technology to enable imaging of extra-solar planets to detect the ones that carry life. Once we find such planets, we will not be satisfied with “just” creating somewhat blurred pictures of these worlds or finding spectroscopic “smoking guns” of life’s existence - we will want to travel there and take a closer look at our cosmic friends. We do not know how long this search will take; we do not know how successful we will be. One thing we do know is that, to make this vision more than just science fiction, we will need to develop radically different observatories and spacecraft. A gossamer telescope, which will produce the first detailed image of an extrasolar planet, will bear little resemblance to any current space observatories. The gossamer telescope will be about 150 times lighter than the Hubble Space Telescope and its diameter will be 10–20 times greater. When such a telescope, or an interferometer consisting of an array of such telescopes, www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 205 will finally produce an image of “the other world,” there will be strong public summon to take an even closer look by means of interstellar travel. In this day and age we envision three major ways that offer the possibility of interstellar travel. They are: matter–antimatter propulsion, nuclear propulsion, and solar sailing – the latter method recently getting much attention. The first-generation interstellar sail missions are envisioned to use gravitational boost from the sun in addition to the solar pressure. In the more distant future, lasers will propel the sails. Flexible structures will eventually make an interstellar sailing possible. The “vision missions” for flexible space structures are the Interstellar Probe and the Extrasolar Planet Imager. Both of these missions can be considered the pinnacles of the technology-development roadmap. Before the technology is ready to enable either of these vision missions, there will be a series of technology-development products benefiting several types of space endeavors. In general, gossamer spacecraft technology will enable very large, ultra-lightweight systems for bold missions of discovery such as: Very large telescopes for imaging extra-solar planets, studying formation of large-scale structure in the early universe, and continuously monitoring the Earth from distant vantage points. Large deployable and inflatable antennas for space-based radio astronomy, high- bandwidth communications from deep space, and Earth remote sensing with radar and radiometers. Solar sails for low-cost propulsion, station keeping in unstable orbits, and precursor interstellar exploration missions. Large solar power collection and transmission systems for human and robotic exploration missions, and for the commercial development of space. The overarching goal of gossamer spacecraft technology development is to achieve breakthroughs in mission capability and cost, primarily through revolutionary advances in structures, materials, optics, and adaptive and multifunctional systems all described briefly in the following sections. (For a more complete discussion of these topics, the reader should refer to the monograph Gossamer Spacecraft: Membrane/Inflatable Structure Technology for Space Applications [11].) 1.2 History of gossamer aerospace structures There has been interest in inflatable deployable space structures since the 1950s due to their potential for low-cost flight hardware, exceptionally high mechanical packaging efficiency, deployment reliability, and low weight. The earliest gossamer aerospace structures were the kite and the balloon. A number of significant technology developments, focused on the demonstration of such potential, include the Good Year antennas in the early 1960s, the Echo Balloon series from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, the Contraves antennas and sun shades in the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, the L’Garde, Inc. inflatable decoys in the 1970s and mid 1980s, and their space- shuttle-launched Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) in May 1996. The IAE was the most recent and the most significant demonstration of this technology. (Further details on the history of gossamer spacecraft can be found in [11].) www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 206 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering NASA’s interest in demonstrating the potential of this relatively new class of space structure resulted in their sponsoring the IN-STEP Inflatable Antenna Experiment, which flew on STS-76 on May 29, 1996 (Fig. 1). L’Garde, Inc., who have been designing, manufacturing, and ground and flight-testing inflatable space structures for the past 30 years, developed the antenna concept used. The experimental objectives were to (a) verify that large inflatable space structures can be built at low cost, (b) demonstrate that large inflatable space structures have high mechanical packaging efficiency, (c) demonstrate that this new class of space structure has high deployment reliability, (d) demonstrate that large membrane reflectors can be manufactured with surface precision of a few millimeters and (e) measure the reflector surface precision on orbit. Figure 1: L’Garde’s Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) during space flight. The IAE inflatable structure was comprised of two basic elements, the inflatable reflector assembly and the torus/strut supporting structure. The reflector assembly formed a 14-meter off-axis parabolic aperture with an f/d of 0.5. The surface accuracy goal was 1.0 mm RMS as compared to a best-fit parabola. The reflector film, 13 m (0.5 mil) aluminized Mylar, was stressed to approximately 8 MPa (1200 psi) by the inflation pressure of 2 Pa (0.0003 psi). This stress level was sufficiently high to assure a good reflective surface for the accuracy measurement system. The canopy was constructed from 62 gores of 13 m (0.5 mil) Mylar, but was left transparent. The torus/strut structure are 610 and 457 mm (24 and 18 inch) in diameter, respectively, and are made with 305 m (12 mil) thick Neoprene coated Kevlar. The function www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 207 of the struts was to locate the reflector assembly at the effective center of curvature of the reflector parabola as required for operation of the Surface Accuracy Measurement Subsystem. The torus also provides the rim support for the reflector assembly without which the reflector assembly would take a spherical shape. The experiment was flown on the recoverable Spartan Spacecraft and demonstrated the main objectives. New, unique, and low-cost space structures technology was demonstrated on orbit by (a) building a large inflatable space antenna structure on the order of about $1,000,000, (b) demonstrating extremely efficient mechanical packaging by stowing a 14 by 28 meter inflatable structure in a container the size of an office desk, (c) manufacturing an offset membrane reflector structure with a surface precision on the order of a few mm RMS, and (d) demonstrating the robustness of deployment for this new class of structure. The results of this experiment were used specifically to establish the technology database, and were the basis of a technology road map for the continued development of this type of space structure. The results of this experiment have been thoroughly documented by Freeland and co-workers. 2 Applications 2.1 Solar arrays L’Garde Inc (Tustin, CA) developed for DARPA and Phillips Laboratory (now Air Force Research Laboratory) an inflatable solar array in 1993. The array supplied 274 W and weighed 2.94 kg (flight model). The array was 3.64 m long and 1.1 m wide. The support tubes were made from stressed aluminum laminate. Figure 2 shows the first controlled inflation of this large space system, deployed only by inflation in the supporting tubes. This system rigidized after inflation so that gas pressure need not be maintained. The array was successfully vibration tested at 12 G in all 3 axes and underwent five thermal cycles under this test program. Complete current - voltage tests were conducted before and after the deployment in vacuum at –90° C. Future commercial and deep-space satellites will require solar arrays with higher specific power densities than the current state-of-the-art, which is on the order of ~40 W/kg, and lower costs to meet mission objectives. Planned communication, radar, DOD, and exploration satellites anticipate power requirements upwards of 30 kW. To meet these needs, revolutionary changes in solar array technology are required. The advantages of using inflatable systems technology in designing a large solar array are reduced stowage volume and mass, increased specific power (greater than 100 W/kg), and reduced cost over current mechanically deployed solar arrays. The inflatable solar array is particularly attractive for missions that demand high power output with launch-vehicle size restrictions. A good example of a solar array construction is the array originally designed under the auspices of the ST4 project in 1999 (Figure 3). The configuration of the ST4 solar array was a modular split blanket style with the deployment tube located on the array centerline. When stowed, the solar array modules were accordion-folded. Sharp’s rigid, high-efficiency silicon photovoltaic assemblies were the basic building blocks for the modular blanket solar array. (Flexible thin-film solar cells using amorphous silicon (Si), copper indium gallium diselenide (GAS) or other materials hold great promise to provide even lower cost and lighter weight photovoltaic modules in similar arrays in the future.) Structural components included the inflatable beam, stowage panels, plume-offset panels, launch ties, and launch tie release mechanism. The inflatable beam could have been fabricated from any of the rigidization systems. However, the thermal heating method was utilized for the flight experiment design. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 208 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Figure 2: L’Garde’s Inflatable Torus Solar Array Technology (ITSAT) deployed in a vacuum tank at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Inflation System Solar Panels Inflatable/Rigidizable Tube 48 ft [14.65 m] Gimbal 9.8 ft [3.00 m] Bottom Panel (Split) Top Panel (Full length) Figure 3: Champollion (ST4) Inflatable Solar Array developed by ILC Dover. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 209 The purpose of the inflatable beam was to provide a deployment mechanism and support structure for the solar array. It is similar in function to the mechanical deployment truss masts currently utilized on spacecraft. The beam was located on the center of the split blanket and was stowed by rolling the tube. The ST4 solar array design was reviewed for use in NASA’s Space Solar Power (SSP) program. The SSP program requires array sizes on the order of 18 kW and a specific power of 250 W/kg. The ST4 solar arrays were designed to be 5.6 kW with a specific power of 102 W/kg. The Teledesic program envisions a constellation of 288 satellites in low earth orbit to provide high data rate communication from anywhere on earth. Original concepts for the satellite included a pair of 6 kW solar arrays (see Fig. 4), with a cost target of $100/W in production. Inflatable technology was considered to be a leading candidate in meeting this goal and was therefore investigated by the Teledesic team. Figure 4: Teledesic Satellite ILC Dover, under contract to Boeing, designed an inflatable structure to support a 3-meter by 10 meter rectangular satellite solar array. A full-scale prototype demonstration unit was also fabricated and used in deployment trials (see Fig. 5). NASA is developing several advanced rover vehicles for exploration of the Martian surface. Several concepts call for large deployable solar arrays to meet the power needs of the rover. One such concept utilizes 1.5-meter deployable wheels and an inflatable solar array to cover vast surface areas in rapid times (see Figure 6). The Mars Rover Solar Array prototype, Figure 6, is a working, full-scale inflatable solar array for rover application. This prototype is a system to be packaged in a small volume for launch and deployed in situ to collect solar energy. The array is parasol shaped and consists of four main components: (1) the canopy, which is the membrane that carries the solar modules; (2) the inflatable torus; (3) the inflatable column; and (4) sixteen solar modules. The sixteen (16) Kapton gores (the individual segments of the canopy) of the solar array are tensioned by a 8.0 cm (tube) diameter by 150 cm (major) diameter, 16-sided inflatable torus, and supported by a 10.0 cm diameter inflatable column. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 210 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Figure 5: Teledesic Inflatable Solar Array deployed at ILC Dover. Figure 6: Inflatable Mars Rover Solar Array Prototype developed by JPL/ILC Dover. Due to the requirement for multiple deployments, the torus of the prototype is constructed from a lightweight aluminized Mylar assembled by pressure-sensitive adhesive tape of the lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 211 same material. The prototype inflatable column is fabricated from a laminate of Kapton and aluminized Mylar. The inflatable torus and column of the future flight unit will be constructed from thin-walled aluminum/Kapton laminates or UV cured laminates. The Mars solar array prototype is capable of generating approximately 20 watts in a terrestrial environment or 12 watts in a Martian environment. Further optimization in cell population pattern, cell efficiency, and mass will further increase specific power to weight ratio. A team consisting of ILC Dover, Aerospace Corporation, Lockheed Martin and NASA Glenn developed and tested a prototype of a so-called Power Sphere (Fig. 7). The Sphere is to be used to power small satellites needing 20–50 W. The size of the Spheres that would provide this power level is between 0.5 and 1 m in diameter. The main attribute of the design is insensitivity of the solar array to attitude, which lowers the overall system mass while reducing the necessity for solar array drives and attitude sensing. Figure 7: Prototype of the Power Sphere. 2.2 Communication systems The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have been studying innovative concepts for large space antennas for several years. One concept has emerged out of these studies as an unequivocal leader - a segmented inflatable reflector based on the premise of seaming together flat-segmented gores of membrane material to form a highly accurate doubly curved surface (see Fig. 8). Inflatable space reflectors show tremendous promise for advancing all antenna parameters simultaneously. Their low mass, high deployment reliability, and small packaging volume reduce the mass, complexity, and cost of a host of missions and spacecraft. Studies estimate that for very large antennas, inflatables are approximately 10 times less expensive, 2–5 times lighter, and have 15–100 times smaller stowage volume than their mechanical counterparts. The low fabrication costs, as well as reduced launch vehicle size, could result in order-of-magnitude cost savings for missions requiring large apertures. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 212 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Figure 8: 3 m and 7 m lenticular antennas built by L’Garde Inc. Large antennas and similar structures find a multitude of applications. Large antennas for space radio telescopes have been extensively described by Chmielewski and co-workers for the ARISE project [3]. Earth-observing antennas, such as for soil moisture and ocean salinity measurements, are primary customers for inflatable antenna technology in the near term. These new antennas will be characterized by: sizes exceeding 25 meters in diameter, fraction of a kilogram per square meter density, and operating frequencies between 1–100 GHz. NASA’s Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) theme needs large apertures for space radio frequency, microwave, and sub-millimeter telescopes. The SEU is also considering a mission to image luminescence created by extremely high-energy particles entering the Earth’s atmosphere. Deep space applications will be developed for Solar System Exploration (SSE) and Sun Earth Connection (SEC), and high bandwidth communication systems for Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS). 2.3 Human habitats Since the earliest of times, humans have desired shelter, and in many cases shelter that was rapidly deployable. One of the earliest forms of constructed shelter was undoubtedly the tent, formed, for example, from animal hides draped over branches. The tent made a significant impact on culture, because it now allowed people to be mobile, to leave their caves or other fixed shelters and migrate, following food and water. The tent exists throughout history, for example playing an essential role in military activities, even today. Modern architectural tension fabric structures are highly sophisticated versions of the ancient tent that are used to span large open spaces. The first air-supported roofs sprang up after the Second World War, when dozens of radomes were constructed to cover radar installations during the intensification of the Cold War. Since that time, air supported roofs have found favor in applications where large clear spans are required, notably recreational facilities such as football stadiums and tennis courts. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 213 Terrestrial aerospace applications of membrane/inflatable human habitats are for the most part associated with providing shelter for aerospace support personnel and equipment. Again, tents play a leading role. Recently, hybrid membrane/inflatables have been developed to provide large, clear span space for aerospace vehicle maintenance, particularly for helicopter repair in the field. Curved beams of cylindrical cross-section are fabricated from coated fabric, and inflated on site. The beams span the space to be covered, supporting the membrane skin of the shelter. A number of intriguing uses of membrane/inflatables are planned for human habitats in space (see Fig. 9). Nearest to earth, inflatables could provide efficient shelter for lunar habitation. Efficient for packaging and lightweight for launch, modules could be inflated on the lunar surface, and then covered with regolith to provide radiation protection for occupants. Inflatable modules have been proposed for space travel as well, for example as modules on planetary rovers or for the International Space Station. Figure 9: Transhab module designed by NASA. 2.4 Planetary surface exploration All present planetary rovers are based on the standard Pathfinder Sojourner concept of a four or six-wheeled vehicle that must generally travel around most obstacles. To give a specific example, during a month of operation after its July 1997 landing on Mars, the 35-cm tall Sojourner rover only traveled a total of about 100 meters, and never more than 7 meters a day. The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) launched in June 2003 are larger than Sojourner and can www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 214 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering climb rocks up to 25 cm high. The rovers will move on the surface of Mars at a speed of 5 cm/s. Membrane technology for surface exploration opens new parameter space. For example, an Inflatable Rover would travel tens of kilometers in a single day, with a range of hundreds of kilometers or more. The use of inflatables to increase speed and range is a critical enabling technology that will allow for robotic outpost development. Functions of inflatable rovers may include transporting other rovers to distant sites, transporting astronauts, and the long-distance transfer of heavy equipment or in situ resources, such as water ice from the Martian North Pole. The Inflatable Rovers (see Fig. 10) would use novel, large inflatable wheels to climb over rocks, instead of traveling around them, thus enabling the rover to traverse quickly over 99% of the Martian surface. Preliminary tests using commercial nylon balloons as tires, a rigid metal chassis, and a simple joystick control, have shown great promise. Rugged, lightweight inflatable wheels and an inflatable-extendable chassis provide the ability to pack the rover into a small planetary entry capsule. An autonomous control system allows the rover to follow an astronaut or to uniquely climb over most obstacles to designated sites in a Mars-like terrain, while carrying smaller, conventional rovers in cooperative rover studies. Figure 10: Jack Jones, JPL, with his Inflatable Rover and the artist’s rendering of the rover deployment using a balloon. The large, inflated spherical wheels allow the rover to basically “swallow” smaller rocks, while providing a large contact surface to climb up steep hills or over larger rocks, and to maintain excellent ground contact during windstorms. In fact, the present, simple 20 kg prototype, which uses commercial nylon balloons as tires (Fig. 10), has stood up well to 13 m/s www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 215 (30 mph) gusts, which is equivalent in force to 130 m/s gusts in the extremely thin Martian atmosphere (0.006 bar pressure). It requires very low power (18 W) to travel 2000 m/h and can climb steep hills. In the near future, designs will also be initiated to allow the rover to carry much larger loads, such as two astronauts, several larger rovers, or heavy equipment and in situ resources, such as water ice from the Martian North Pole. A recent, preliminary design of a Mars astronaut transporter system is shown in Figure 11, which evolved from previous Lunar Apollo astronaut rovers. This design will likely be modified to include larger, more rugged inflatable wheels, and may include a removable habitat. Figure 11: Inflatable Mars Rover trailer developed by a JPL team led by Jack Jones. Inflatable technology is also critical and enabling in the area of Titan Robotics, since this type of rover is the only one thus far capable of operating on the liquid methane lakes anticipated on Titan. Numerous materials, such as Kevlar, Mylar, and PBO, are known to be capable of functioning well in cryogenic conditions, and the large tires can actually help insulate critical electronics from the frigid Titan surface. This insulating factor can also help prevent the rover from sublimating/melting into icy surfaces, such as on Europa, Callisto, and other moons, including the known polar ice crater on our own Earth’s moon. In the near future, inflatable rovers will also help in the successful long-distance transport of critical equipment and in-situ resources for astronauts, such as the transporting of Mars North Pole water ice, as well as the transportation of astronauts themselves on Mars. Control systems will also allow equipment rovers to follow walking astronauts or develop detached trains of equipment that follow in line. Witold Sokolowski of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, working with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan, also is developing a new alternative to space rigidizable material called the Cold Hibernated Elastic Memory (CHEM) structures (see Fig. 12). This material technology utilizes shape memory polymers in open cellular (foam) structures. The CHEM foams are self- deployable and are using the foam’s elastic recovery plus their shape memory to erect structures. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 216 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering JPL launched two rovers to Mars in 2003. The landers containing the rovers were designed to touch down on the surface of Mars cushioned by large air bags (see Fig. 13). The air bags are an evolutionary design from the Mars Pathfinder. The MER bags are designed for 40% increase in the payload delivery in comparison with the Pathfinder. Figure 12: CHEM nano-rover wheels. Outside diameter is 6 cm. Figure 13: Mars Exploration Rover air bags developed by ILC Dover. A non-NASA commercial area studied by Federal Fabrics and Fibers is the use of an inflatable rover for land-mine traversing and detecting. With very light mass and a large contact area, the pressure on the ground is below the threshold for mine detonation. Outfitted with land-mine detectors, this rover could potentially help rid the world of the 100 million active, buried land mines. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 217 In the more distant future, it is envisioned that there will be more lightweight, highly packageable equipment operating on surfaces of planets. Such a vision is portrayed in Figure 14, which shows inflatable rigidizable towers for cellular communications, inflatable solar power energy generation stations, in situ resource utilization tanks, rovers, and thin-film solar sails delivering cargo to the planet. Figure 14: Artist’s rendering of inflatable equipment on Mars. 2.5 Radar and reflectarrays There is a critical need for enabling technologies that will reduce the mass, physical size, and cost of antennas. The inflatable SAR and Reflectarray described in this section represent advanced antenna technology that has the potential for providing an enhanced communication capability with relatively lower cost (1/10), smaller size (1/100 launch volume) and smaller mass (1/2) than current technologies. A SAR program demonstrates the feasibility of a low-mass inflatable Synthetic Aperture Radar Array Antenna. Figure 15 shows the prototype system, including a flat, multiple-layered, metalized, thin-film micro strip array (a three-membrane assembly), tensioned and supported by an inflated frame that can be rigidized after deployment. The size of the full-scale array is 10 m × 3.3 m. The system was stowed in a rolled-up configuration on the spacecraft bus, and was deployed in a controlled manner via inflation gas. The objective of this program was to develop a functional subscale system that was less than 2 kg/m 2 of radiating area when projected to full scale. The depicted subscale prototype met the requirements and demonstrated the feasibility of the low mass SAR concept. The deployment method and supporting frame concept used in the SAR could also be used for a flexible blanket-type solar array in future developments. That is, the membrane assembly of the SAR could be replaced with a flexible thin-film solar-cell blanket and the system would then act as an inflatable solar array. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 218 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Figure 15: Inflatable Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) developed by Michael Lou (JPL) and ILC Dover. The 3-m Ka-Band Reflectarray program is another recent development effort to demonstrate the feasibility of super low mass telecommunication and space-deployed SAR concepts. This 3-m prototype (see Fig. 16) consists of four major subassemblies: (1) the membrane assembly, (2) the rigid frame assembly, (3) the inflatable frame assembly, and (4) the suspension system. Figure 16: JPL and ILC Dover 3-m Ka-Band Inflatable Micro Strip Reflectarray. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 219 A horseshoe-shaped structure assembled from a straight rigid frame assembly and a U- shaped inflatable frame assembly suspends the reflectarray membrane. The rigid frame assembly is made from graphite epoxy with aluminum end caps. The inflatable frame assembly is fabricated from urethane-coated Kevlar to simulate a rigidizable material in the final application. The membrane support frame is 25 cm in diameter and the feed horn support torus is 7.5 cm in diameter. Three vertical struts grouped within 90 degrees of each other support the feed horn torus. The struts are tapered in diameter, from the larger diameter of the membrane support tube to the smaller diameter of the feed horn torus, to minimize material in the RF path, as well as in the system mass. One of the critical requirements for reflectarrays is the flatness of the membrane. For this reason many packaging and deployment concepts are considered, with the current configuration being the best for this particular application. Again, similar to the rectangular frame used for the SAR array, the horseshoe frame concept could also be used for solar array deployment. The main beam of the micro-strip reflectarray, unlike that of a parabolic reflector, can be designed to point at a large fixed angle (up to 60 deg) from the broadside direction. With the reflectarray integrated with low-loss phase shifters, a very large space borne beam scanning array antenna is now feasible. By developing this novel phased reflectarray concept, the complicated beam forming network, high-cost phase shifters, and high-cost transmit/receive (T/R) modules of a conventional phased array are no longer needed. A reflectarray antenna can even be combined with a solar array. Such a system would allow launching very large high power, large-aperture spacecraft on small launch vehicles. The reliability of such an array is very high. Since each element in the reflectarray is isolated from others, the failure of one element will have insignificant impact on the performance of the complete antenna with thousands of elements. If 1/10 of the total number of elements fails, the drop in antenna gain is only 0.5 dB. The inflatable reflectarray lends itself to very large sizes. A 20-m X-band antenna is feasible. Because it is much simpler to manufacture an inflatable structure, such a structure will be much less expensive and reliable to deploy than conventional mechanically deployed systems. An inflatable “light SAR” would provide new capabilities in target detection and monitoring, foliage penetration, and topographic mapping. 2.6 Solar concentrators There has been interest in solar propulsion since Kraft Ehricke first presented the concept in 1956. Solar propulsion is an alternative to chemical, electrical, and nuclear propulsion for inter- orbital, lunar, and interplanetary transfer missions. Chemical rockets require both fuel and oxidizer that, while providing high thrust, are extremely heavy and inefficient. Conversely, electrical propulsion is extremely efficient but provides very low thrust values. Nuclear propulsion overcomes many of these shortfalls, but has serious issues associated with safe ground handling and launch. Only a single propellant is required for solar propulsion, which can provide moderate thrusts and efficiencies, with minimal safety concerns. Solar energy is collected and focused onto a thruster. The single hydrogen gas working fluid is heated and expanded by solar-heated material in or surrounding the cavity. The expanding gas provides thrust without ignition or combustion. Laug and co-workers at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Edwards site, have developed concepts to use membrane/inflatables as the solar concentrators. Similar to a membrane/inflatable antenna, these large double-curved concentrators could be packaged into a small volume for launch, and then inflated on orbit (see Fig. 17). www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 220 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Solar concentrators can also be used directly to improve solar-electric efficiency. Photovoltaic (PV) cells have a relatively low efficiency, and carrying more photocells is a trade with increased mass. Another approach is to concentrate more sunlight (photons) onto a smaller number of cells. The Naval Research Lab has worked on concepts for a deployable membrane PV concentrator. These planar sheets would be placed on either side of a photovoltaic panel, forming a trough for concentrating sunlight. Figure 17: 5-m solar concentrator developed by SRS of Huntsville, Alabama. 2.7 Solar sails and sunshades In the early part of the last century when physicists first began to gain a better understanding of the nature of light, it became apparent that electromagnetic waves could, in certain circumstances, demonstrate properties typical of particles. Photons, or quantized “particles of light”, each have an associated momentum equal to h/, where h is Planck’s constant, and is the wavelength. Solar sails operate by using solar photon momentum exchange to accelerate a spacecraft; at 1 AU, the applied force is about 9 N/km 2. As such, a solar sail has ‘infinite’ specific impulse because it requires no propellant. Sunlight falling on a large lightweight surface is a highly efficient method of changing the orbital energy of spacecraft. There is no need to carry onboard propulsion or fuel, and thus the reduced mass allows greater payload capacity and much shorter trip times for high-energy missions. The constant low thrust counteracts gravity to enable unique non-Keplerian orbits and new vantage points for space-physics measurements. Eventually, sails that use laser energy beamed from Earth may enable rapid access to all parts of the solar system and beyond. Solar sails represent one of the few propulsion technologies that can be developed rapidly within the next decade, and lead to dramatic improvements in space exploration capability and affordability. Using solar-photon pressure to accelerate a spacecraft, solar sails enable a large www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 221 number of very propulsion-intensive missions, from non-Keplerian orbits, to solar polar missions at less than 1 AU, to fast trips to the edge of our solar system. Advances in thin-film materials, novel high-temperature sail substrates, and light-weight booms, combined with the need for low total mission costs, make sails a high-payoff space- transportation technology. Significant technology development that addresses issues of sail storage, deployment, and control is needed. Developing sails for propulsion applications is synergistic with other work on large gossamer thin-film space structures, such as the James Webb Space Telescope Sunshade, and large inflatable concentrators and antennas. Furthermore, solar sails represent the first step in beamed energy propulsion technology, where reflected laser light or microwave radiation provides the momentum to propel sail craft on interstellar mission. Solar sails are a key to lowering the cost of accessing space beyond low- Earth orbit as well as enabling new science missions. In the near term, the Team Encounter is planning an imaginative mission to use a sail built by L’Garde to deliver a capsule containing DNA and digital pictures of thousands of program participants beyond the solar system. NOAA is also studying a joint mission with Team Encounter to test the sail technology for “pole sitter” satellites. The NASA New Millennium Program is studying space validation of solar-sail technology for the ST9 mission. Intermediate applications could see the use of solar sails for fast missions to the outer solar system, heliopause, and perhaps the first mission into the interstellar medium. In the far term, a light sail, which uses light from sources other than the sun to accelerate, may provide the first propulsion technique to start a man-made object on a journey to another star. Sail use has the potential to reduce trip times dramatically because of the very high mission velocities achievable through close solar perihelion trajectories; depending on the sail materials, payload, and configuration, this could be well in excess of 100 km/s for solar sails in the next decade. Similarly, propulsion system mass could see significant reductions as lower areal density materials and advanced support structures become available. A primary performance parameter for solar sails is their areal density (g/m 2). This parameter is an important measure of sail performance because it determines the acceleration of the sail (i.e., solar pressure [N/km 2] divided by areal density [g/m 2] gives acceleration). Areal density is determined by the thickness and density of the sail material, and the mass of the supporting structure. The term “loaded areal density” refers to the entire sail craft mass, including payload, divided by sail area. Dimensions range from tens of meters for small spacecraft with fairly modest mission velocity increment requirements, to hundreds of meters for more ambitious missions to the outer solar system. Solar sail areal density requirements range from around 20 g/m 2 to perform near-term demonstration missions, to around 1 g/m 2 to accomplish fast missions to the heliopause. Operating temperature is another figure of merit for solar sails, as it dictates minimum solar distance and therefore maximum achievable acceleration for a given sail areal density. Maximum operating temperature is governed by the sail material’s reflectivity and emissivity. Sail-craft survivability also merits serious consideration by mission planners. Understanding sail performance degradation over time due to space environmental effects – micrometeoroid impacts, radiation, and sail charging – will be critical for successfully completing sail missions. Sails can carry a spacecraft inbound toward the sun by using the solar-photon pressure to slow down in the direction of orbital motion; the spacecraft then being accelerated inward by the sun’s gravitational pull. Spacecraft can spiral outward from the sun by positioning the sail to increase heliocentric orbital velocity. Sails can also be used for inner planet rendezvous missions or for applications that would prohibit more conventional propulsion approaches such as planetary “pole sitters”. At Earth, an initial sail deployment altitude of around 2000 km is www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 222 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering needed so that atmospheric drag is significantly less than solar pressure. Nevertheless, sails can be used for planetary spiral-out and capture. There are several solar-sail design concepts that mission planners have considered; square and heliogyro sails represent the designs examined in the Halley Comet Rendezvous and subsequent mission studies of the 1970s. The inflatable sail concept is a recent innovation derived from inflatable antenna and structures technology. Deployment of round, spin- stabilized sails has been demonstrated in space with the Russian Znamya sails deployed by Progress vehicles. The square sail consists of a thin sheet of metalized plastic stretched over a supporting lightweight boom. Small vanes are located at the corners of the sail; they are rotated to produce differential light pressure for use in maneuvering the sail. Alternatively, the sail can be maneuvered by shifting the center of mass relative to the center of (light) pressure. The World Space Foundation, a non-profit organization that recently has been incorporated into the Planetary Society, built a prototype square sail 880 m 2 in area for demonstrating on-orbit deployment and maneuvering. However, the sail was never flown in space. The second type of sail, the heliogyro, is spun like a helicopter blade; the thin-sheet sail material is unrolled and stabilized by centripetal acceleration. Maneuvering is accomplished by changing the pitch of the blades. The heliogyro sail is easier to deploy than the square sail, has a greater stability from random disturbances (due to its rotational inertia), but has a slower maneuvering rate due to the rotational inertia. Thus, the two types of sails have different strengths and weaknesses, although the square sail, with its faster maneuvering response, might be favored for missions involving extensive planetary escape and capture spiral orbits. Figure 18: Artist’s rendering of a sail rendezvous with an asteroid. More generally, light sails provide spacecraft propulsion by using photon pressure from any light source; laser sails and microwave sails are two concepts that would require a source for beaming energy to a spacecraft. The source might be either ground- or space-based depending upon the mission requirements. Because of the infrastructure required for beamed-energy light www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 223 sails, these concepts are longer term and merit lower Technology Readiness Level (TRL) ratings. Beamed energy sail concepts are among the few propulsion techniques that hold promise for interstellar missions; such applications would require kilometer-scale sails with areal densities on the order of 0.1 g/m 2. Solar sails are being considered for several missions planned in the NASA Sun-Earth Connection (SEC) theme, including a Solar Polar Imager, and the first-generation Interstellar Probe launched to explore the outer reaches of the solar system. Several missions of the NASA Solar System Exploration (SSE) theme would also be greatly enhanced by the use of solar sails, such as missions to comets and the outer planets (see Fig. 18). This technology could also enable large sunshields needed to stabilize and protect large gossamer apertures and other cryogenic telescopes. ILC Dover designed and manufactured several sail quadrants with deployment systems (see Figure 19). The average sail areal density was 6 g/m 2. The design included rip stops and deployment control systems. The material used for sail was 1 micron thick polyester film with Al/Cr coating. The finished assemblies were 7 m × 7 m × 10 m and 13 m × 13 m × 18 m. Multiple deployment tests were conducted at JPL and ILC. Figure 19: Solar-sail quadrant developed by ILC Dover. NASA is currently engaging in technology development for the James Webb Space Telescope (NGST) Mission scheduled to be flown in 2007. This mission, managed by GSFC, envisions a near infrared, 6-m aperture telescope to be positioned at L2 orbit for 5 to 10 years. In order to passively cool the telescope to below 60 K for maximum science return, a very large (up to 32 m by 14 m) sunshield with multiple-layers of thermal membranes was studied. The inflatable design offered several inherent advantages, including lighter weight and smaller launches volume, over its mechanically deployed counterpart. More importantly, an inflatable sunshield will be much less complex (e.g., at least one order of magnitude less number of parts) than a mechanically deployed sunshield. Less complexity leads to higher reliability, and cheaper fabrication and assembly costs. ILC Dover worked with JPL and GSFC on the JWST sunshield program. The goal of that program was to demonstrate a 1/3-scale model of the JWST sunshield on a shuttle flight www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 224 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering experiment named ISIS (Inflatable Sunshield In Space). A scale model was demonstrated in 1G; however, the ISIS program was cancelled and never tested in space (Fig. 20). Figure 20: ISIS Deployed Configuration. Figure 21: NGST half-scale sunshield. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 225 The sunshield was a diamond shaped membrane structure that measured approximately 5 × 11 × 1 m when deployed. The system consisted of four layers of membranes that were deployed and supported by four inflatable beams, which later rigidized to provide a permanent structure. The membranes, when stowed, were accordion-folded or “Z” folded into a small packing volume around the bus structure. The roll-up method for controlled deployment and the heat-cured thermoset composite laminates were baselined for this demonstration. The system shown in Figure 21 was a half-scale model deployed at ILC with a gravity- negation system attached to the sunshield. The booms were rolled and attached to the tips of the membranes and contain deployment control mechanisms. During deployment the booms unroll and dispense the membrane from the packing container in a controlled fashion. At full deployment of the membranes, the booms (aluminum laminates in this case) were inflated to a prescribed pressure to “rigidize” them, and then they were subsequently vented. Solar sails are being considered for several missions planned in the Sun-Earth Connection (SEC) Division at NASA, including a Solar Polar Imager, and the first-generation Interstellar Probe launched to explore the outer reaches of the solar system. Several missions of the Solar System Exploration (SSE) theme would also be greatly enhanced by the use of solar sails, such as missions to comets and the outer planets. This technology could also enable large sunshields needed to stabilize and protect large gossamer apertures and other cryogenic telescopes, and block out unnecessary light (occulting) for imaging planets near stars (see Fig. 22). Figure 22: Sail occulter concept by Glenn Starkman, Case Western Reserve University. 2.8 Structural members Membrane/inflatable structural members may take the form of rods, beams, rings, and the like. These members may find applications individually, in combinations with other structural members, or in conjunction with membrane structures. Research is underway to develop methods for rigidizing these members after inflation/deployment. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 226 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Inflatable rods of circular cross-section are fitted with end caps that allow them to be used as struts, or linked to form trusses. The recently launched Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) used three pneumatic rods as struts to connect the antenna reflector to the feed. Prototypes for inflatable trusses go back at least to the 1950s and work at Goodyear on inflatable radar systems. Besides providing axial resistance as struts, inflated cylinders also have bending rigidity and thus act as beams. An inflated cantilever cylinder can act as a boom for extending the reach of an astronaut. In an inflatable airplane, they can act as wing girders. Curved pneumatic beams were discussed above as being used for structural support in inflatable habitats. Curved beams, closed onto themselves, form pneumatic rings or tori. The IAE used a pneumatic ring to provide reaction for the inflated membrane reflector, and also as the attachment point for the pneumatic struts; other examples are given throughout this chapter as well. Structures that respond to service loads primarily through membrane action do so typically because of a combination of small thickness and/or low modulus. For thin structures, bending resistance may be orders of magnitude smaller than membrane resistance, such that the former provides only a minor contribution to load resistance, if at all. An important by-product of thinness is that membrane structures are typically no-compression structures. A (possibly localized) buckling or wrinkling will occur upon subjecting a membrane structure to compressive loads, and this becomes a principal design driver. The literature on membrane/inflatable structures members is significant, and has been thoroughly reviewed by Jenkins and co-workers. Two works are of particular interest in the present context. An early interest in inflatable re-entry vehicles motivated a study by Leonard and co-workers in 1960. They reported on an inflatable cantilever cylinder, made simple “strength-of-materials projections of maximum tip load before collapse, and provided some brief experimental evidence. Main and co-workers conducted a similar investigation on inflated fabric cantilever cylinders. Recent interest in inflatable boom technology has been significant. Membrane structures rarely exist of and by themselves. They usually require some support structure, especially to carry compression. Examples include the already-mentioned hybrid membrane/inflatable tents and the IAE. 2.9 Telescopes and optics Deployable space-based parabolic membrane optics is of current interest to NASA and DOD, and in particular to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). The interest is driven by the potential for large reduction in launch costs, through reduced structure mass and stowed cargo volume. In addition to large space-based optical quality membrane telescopes, this technology can be used for radio and radar antenna, as well as solar power and propulsion systems. Regardless of the use, one stringent requirement for the success of this project is the surface accuracy of the deployed optical membrane. The surface precision required for optical quality mirrors is rigorous. A typical uncompensated ‘/20 specification’ (i.e., 1/20 th the wavelength of interest) requires a mirror with a surface precision less than a micron rms. Precise grinding and polishing is essential in the production of conventional rigid optics in order to achieve such tolerances. For space-based applications, rigid optics is limited by both volume and mass, due to launch cargo capacity and thrust capacity. Therefore, in order to produce large space-based optics, a lightweight, deployable but precise structure is necessary to minimize both mass and volume, but maintain high performance. However, rapid technology developments in wavefront reconstruction and adaptive optics provide an opportunity for the stringent precision requirements to be relaxed somewhat. In www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 227 particular, holographic spatial light modulation techniques show promise to work in conjunction with membrane optics to achieve the desired performance levels. When the AFRL began the research into developing deployable optics several years ago, the focus was on inflatable structures comprised of a membrane mirror and highly transparent canopy (lenticular configuration), along with the surrounding inflatable/rigidizeable support structure. The objective was to obtain a near-net parabolic shape by inflating either a plane monolithic circular membrane, or cutting and assembling flat gores such that the final shape was parabolic. Through this research it was determined that the requirements placed on both the transparent canopy and support structure were highly demanding. An alternative means of achieving and maintaining the desired figure needed to be found. Spin casting of polymer film appears to be an ideal method for producing a near-net shape parabolic membrane that does not require an inflatable lenticular. Spinning mercury has proven effective in creating optically fast primary mirrors for telescopes. To produce the mold, this spinning method could be used with a hardening liquid that cures in a near-net parabolic shape. The solidifying substrate could then be produced atop the mold in the same spin-casting fashion. Finally, optical coatings can be applied such that the coating places tension on the substrate, thereby making it a \"semi-rigid\" structure capable of maintaining a near-net parabolic shape upon release from the mold. More details are given in Gossamer Spacecraft: Membrane/Inflatable Structure Technology for Space Applications [11]. NASA is studying future missions requiring very large space observatories. The long-range goal of the Astronomical Search for Origins and Planetary Systems (ASO) Division in the Space Science Enterprise is to detect and characterize planets in orbit around nearby stars. This grand challenge is a driver for gossamer technology development of large apertures (Fig. 23). Figure 23: Gossamer telescope concept by Roger Angel and Neville Woolfe of University of Arizona. Independent of any specific instrument concept, the basic detection physics sets minimum requirements for the optical apertures. Set against the benchmark of the largest ground-based telescopes and the 6-m James Webb Telescope (JWT), terrestrial planet spectroscopic www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 228 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering characterization requires a ten-fold increase in aperture area, and low-resolution direct imaging requires an additional 25-fold increase in area. Such large collection area requirements most likely preclude implementing the missions with single telescopes. Rather, such missions are currently envisioned to utilize constellations of large telescopes flying in formation and operating as interferometers. The basic building block for these systems is likely to be diffraction-limited optical collectors of 20–40-m diameter. One of the critical metrics for such systems is the areal density of the fully loaded primary mirror (optical surface, reaction structure, actuators, and wiring). An areal density of 100 kg/m 2 is typical for conventional telescopes. The JWT is striving to achieve areal densities between 10 and 15 kg/m 2. For future ASO missions, areal densities of 1 kg/m 2 or less are required to enable affordable system architectures. Ultimately, to achieve higher resolution imagery and spectroscopy, even more aggressive architectures with collecting areas equivalent to much larger (100s to 1000s of meters) aperture diameters and much lower areal densities (< 0.1 kg/m 2) will be required. Large aperture technologies also have direct applicability to the needs of other NASA missions. Large apertures are needed for advanced X-ray, space radio frequency, microwave, and submillimeter telescopes. Large space radio telescopes and Earth-observing antennas, such as for soil-moisture and ocean-salinity measurements, will need great improvements in antenna technology in the near term. These new antennas will be characterized by sizes exceeding 25 m in diameter, fraction of a kilogram per square meter density, and operating frequencies between 1–100 GHz. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory built and tested a 5-m Fresnel lens in 2002 as part of the Eyeglass project. This lens consists of 72 thin-glass (790 m thick) panels, aligned and attached together in a foldable, origami-based, configuration. The f/50 lens has been optically tested, delivering tight focal spots at several visible laser wavelengths. While this lens demonstrates that large aperture, lightweight (1.7 kg/m 2) diffractive lenses can be made, it was primarily built as a prototype for much larger, space-based lenses; future lenses are expected to be built from thin polymer films, reaching 50–100-m sizes with specific masses of < 0.1 kg/m 2. Mark Dragovan of JPL has presented a revolutionary design. Dragovan noted that a surface with zero Gaussian curvature is either flat or has the shape of a trough, so that one of the principal curvatures is always zero. Bending along only one axis can form such a surface. If the shape of the surface in the curved direction is a parabola, then a line focus results for an incident plane wave. To produce a point focus, a system of two trough-shaped reflectors properly oriented with respect to each other must be used (Fig. 24). This layout takes advantage of a two-mirror reflector system where the individual reflectors are parabolic cylinders. The orientation and curvatures of the individual reflectors are chosen so that a point focus results for an incident plane wave. Tensioning a reflective foil over a frame, which has a parabolic contour along one axis and is rigid enough to support the tensioning, forms the parabolic-cylindrical surfaces. Other applications that could benefit from large aperture technology include high-resolution imagers for land and tropospheric wind studies, radar for Earth and Space Science, deep-space communications, and large-scale solar power generation. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) represents the current state of the art in space apertures. The aperture size of the HST is 2.4-m diameter and the areal density of the aperture system is approximately 150 kg/m 2. Technological advances will be needed to archive 20–40-m aperture diameters and less than 1 kg/ m 2 densities. In the area of solar sails it is difficult to specify what the state of the art is, as no solar sail has ever flown. The cost of these systems will also have to be drastically reduced. No firm metrics for cost exist yet, but it is expected that the current www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 229 level of funding per mission will not increase in the future. Even the most capable telescopes will have to stay within a cost cap of the currently planned telescopes such as JWST or Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF). Figure 24: Artist's rendering of DART telescope and a ray trace showing the principle of a dual parabolic reflector. 3 Membrane materials 3.1 Materials for membrane/inflatables in space Two characteristics are common to all membrane/inflatables: flexibility and lightweight. Both of these are achieved through some combination of low modulus and thinness of the material. Stiffness scales with modulus and geometric dimension, while weight scales with density and geometric dimension. As an elementary example, consider the axial stiffness of a rod under tension P displacing an amount x, or P = krx. Here, the stiffness k can be shown to be equal to EA/L, where E is the modulus, A is the cross-sectional area, and L is the length. Note that making the rod thinner decreases the stiffness, as well as the weight. Similarly, the stiffness of a beam in bending is kb ~ EI/L3, where I is the area moment of inertia of the beam; again, decrease in thickness (decrease in I) decreases both stiffness and weight. The stiffness of a membrane can be shown to be km ~ Eh, where h is the membrane thickness. Hence, the thinner the membrane, the more flexible (compliant) it becomes, and www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 230 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering consequently the lighter in weight as well. Thus membrane/inflatable materials come typically either as thin polymer sheets or films, or thin-walled polymer tubes. A number of candidate polymer films exist today. One of the earliest space-based films in use was Mylar, a polyester film usually coated with a thin layer of metal. Mylar was used to construct the Echo series of satellites, and is still used in high-altitude balloons and other space applications today. Kapton, a polyimide, has been a commonly used membrane material for recent space applications. More recently, several polyimide derivatives (e.g., TOR, COR, CP1, and CP2) have been developed with various improved properties. A number of mechanical and other properties are of special interest in space gossamer spacecraft, including: Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) Modulus Low-temperature toughness Low-temperature ductility Dimensional stability Aging Surface smoothness Bend radius (esp. after coating) Potential to be “active” or to be integrated with active materials Potential to be “rigidized” Strength is not included in the list. Although a nominal amount of strength is required, membrane/inflatables will in general be lightly loaded, with stress and strain levels at much less than their ultimate values. Low modulus values will also help to keep stress levels low, even though strain levels may be high. Failure by fracture or collapse is much more likely than tensile failure. Other properties are also important for different applications. For example, optical properties are important in imaging applications. Electrical and thermal conductivity, and electromagnetic properties may be of interest across a number of applications. Environmental compatibility and survivability are important in nearly every application, and these issues are discussed in a separate section of this chapter. 3.2 Rigidization technology For any long-term space application, an inflatable structure needs to be rigidized. This is because leaks will be developed through small holes in the walls of the inflatable, created by impacting micrometeoroids and space debris. If the structure is rigidized upon the completion of its inflation deployment, the need to carry a large amount of make-up gas to compensate for leaks can be eliminated. Since the early 1960s, many researchers have engaged in finding the best rigidization methods for space inflatable structures. These include the development of a number of polymers that can be cured by space environments, such as vacuum, ultraviolet (UV) light, infrared (IR) energy, and low temperature. Several pioneering methods, e.g., solvent-loss systems, were part of these early efforts. In a solvent-loss system, a volatile plasticizer leaves the impregnated fabric that forms the wall of tubular inflatable structure, as soon as the structure is deployed in vacuum. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 231 The desired features for space rigidization include: Easily adaptive to high-efficiency packaging Compatible with controlled deployment scheme No or low space power required No or low in-orbit out gassing or contamination Predictable post-rigidization configuration accuracy Adaptive to ground handling and testing The space rigidization methods currently under favorable considerations and/or active development include: Stretched aluminum laminate Hydro-gel rigidization Open-cell foam Heat cured thermoset composite laminates (thermal heating) Thermoplastic composite laminates (passive cooling) UV curable composite laminates Foam injection Inflation gas reaction laminates Bonding thin aluminum foils to polymer films, such as Kapton, makes sandwich laminates that can be rigidized. While the polymer films provide tear resistance and a gas seal, the aluminum foils are stretched by pressure just above the yield point to provide rigidity of the inflatable structure. Figure 25 illustrates the stretched aluminum laminate method. To rigidize the cross-section, the structure is inflated to eliminate the wrinkles in the laminate and to a point of just yielding the aluminum. After yielding the aluminum, the Kapton/aluminum laminate is ‘rigidized’ and will maintain structural integrity. The inflation gas is then vented to space. A typical aluminum laminate cross-section consists of two multiple-layered components: (1) the multiple layer insulation (MLI) blanket, and (2) the support tube laminate. The MLI blanket is similar to that used for thermal-cured laminates, and it is tailored to mission environment and requirements. The support tube laminate is fabricated from layers of Kapton – adhesive – aluminum – adhesive – Kapton laminate. The thickness of each layer and the number of layers used can be tailored and designed to mission-specific requirements. In addition to taking advantage of the inflation system that is already needed for deployment, this method also offers the following distinct advantages: (1) it can accommodate inflatable tubes that are either rolled up or z-folded; (2) it does not require power; and (3) it has a negligible level of out gassing. More importantly, both of the two component materials, aluminum and Kapton, of the stretched aluminum laminate have a long heritage of space applications. On the other hand, there remains a major shortcoming of the stretched aluminum laminate rigidization method that needs to be overcome. Since, due mainly to packaging constraints, only a very thin (no more than 0.005 inch) aluminum layer can be incorporated in the laminate, the inflatable/rigidizable tubes made of stretched aluminum laminates can only be used to carry relatively low axial loads. For the cases that involve high compression and/or significant bending loads, the thin-walled aluminum laminate tubes tend to fail by local crimping. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 232 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Figure 25: Aluminum laminate rigidization. Figure 26: L’Garde truss assembly. Hydro-gel rigidization is a rigidization method that has potential applications to certain classes of space inflatable structures. This method has been successfully applied by L’Garde to develop an inflatable/rigidizable space truss. The truss (see Fig. 26) is formed by tubular elements that are assembled together with complex metal joints. Each tubular element is basically a cylindrical tube that is made of woven graphite fabric and impregnated with a water-soluble resin (hydro-gel). Evaporation of the water content in the impregnated hydro-gel www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 233 will occur after inflation deployment in vacuum and the dehydrated hydro-gel rigidizes to give structural stiffness to individual tubular elements. Like other solvent-loss systems, one major advantage of the hydro-gel method is that the rigidization process is completely reversible. That is, the rigidized inflatable structure can absorb water, get softened, and be re-rigidized repeatedly to facilitate ground testing and measurements of the flight inflatable structures. Other on-going space rigidization development efforts include heat-cured composites (thermoplastic and thermoset) at ILC-Dover, cold rigidization at L’Garde, and UV-cured composites at Adherent Technologies. JPL, working with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan, is also developing a new type of space rigidizable material, called Cold Hibernated Elastic Memory (CHEM). CHEM is formulated by incorporating shape-memory polymers into open-cellular foam. This material has a maximum deployed/stowed volume ratio of 30 and is self-expanded when heated up above its glass transition temperature. This means that a space rigidizable structure made of CHEM does not need an inflation system to deploy. Figure 27: Composite laminate cross-section. The Thermal Heating method has undergone further development at ILC Dover for potential flight experiments. The composite-laminate system, which consists of thermoset matrix resin and fiber reinforcement such as graphite, is cured or rigidized by heating. The thermoset resin hardens after being heated to a specified temperature and cure time. This rigidization method can be designed to cure from solar energy, or from the spacecraft power, or from a combination of both. The properties of the composite material are consistent with those used in today’s spacecraft design. A typical composite laminate cross-section, as shown in Figure 27, consists of two multiple-layered components: (1) the MLI blanket, and (2) the support-tube laminate. The MLI heating blanket is designed and fabricated from various layers of vapor-deposited aluminum (VDA) Kapton, VDA Mylar, and spacers. The purpose of the MLI blanket is to keep out the harsh space environment and at the same time maintain the required curing temperature www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 234 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering inside. The design of the MLI blanket is tailored to the specific mission environment and requirements. The support-tube laminate typically consists of four separate layers: (1) the restraint layer that maintains the shape of the inflatable structure; (2) the heater assembly layer, which provides the proper temperature for deployment and curing (in some designs the restraint layer and the heater layer are combined to become one assembly); (3) the rigidizable composite laminate layer, fabricated from prepreg materials such as epoxy/graphite, is the support structure when cured; and (4) the bladder layer, manufactured from black Kapton, keeps and maintains inflation pressure during deployment. The thermoplastic composite laminates, which use passive cooling as the curing method, has a similar construction. 4 Flexible systems 4.1 Adaptive compensation The ever-increasing need for higher antenna gains and efficiencies at ever-higher frequencies has led to the consideration of various types of inflatable precision apertures. Recent advances in reflector materials, design, analysis, predictive modeling and manufacturing are expected to yield accuracies almost an order of magnitude higher than present practice for surfaces of <1 mm RMS. However, one of the problems related to high-frequency performance of these inflatable reflectors is the surface distortion caused by thermal effects, in addition to the initial distortion caused by imperfections in the manufacture process, and long-term changes in the material properties. Both of these distortions are slowly varying as a function of time. There is also a problem with accurate pointing of the structure. There are several solutions to this problem, and some combination of technologies will likely prove to be most effective (Figure 28). Figure 28: Elements of an aperture system designed for maximum antenna performance: the main reflector with torus, smart support structure, active secondary and electronic feed. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 235 Adaptive secondary reflectors Combining the inflatable apertures with mechanically shaped secondary reflectors will further improve the aperture efficiency, as recently demonstrated on a 3.3-m secondary reflector by Composite Optics (Fig. 29) in a project for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO.) The final wavefront correction can be accomplished using phased-array electronic compensation at the aperture focal region. This combined effect of improved primary, adaptive secondary, and phased-array compensation will improve the effective aperture surface accuracy by two orders of magnitude, and is expected to push the inflatable aperture performance into high radio frequencies and sub millimeter applications. Figure 29: COI’s 3.3-m adaptive reflector for 90–900 GHz applications. Holographic correction One of the most promising methods for active compensation is a passive holographic technique utilized to allow existing reflector technology to be used in the optical spectrum, yielding apparent surface precision in the 1.0-micron range. Thin membrane inflatable reflectors utilizing this technology could be used for space projects requiring large apertures for optics. Boundary manipulation It has been well proven analytically that manipulating the boundary of certain classes of inflatable reflectors can make significant improvements to their surface accuracy. Initial experimental studies have also verified this effect. Selective heating It has been shown analytically that temperature gradients over the surface of a membrane/inflatable cut both ways: they may either distort or improve the surface accuracy. Selective heating may be considered as potential future shape control strategy. Array feed and deformable flat plate (DFP) There have been many studies and experiments that use either array feeds or a DFP (investigated by William Imbriale of JPL) to compensate for reflector distortions. In many cases, especially for the DFP, it is assumed that the distortions are both stable and known, while for the array feed generally an adaptive system has been proposed. The disadvantage of the array approach is that the spread of the energy in the focal plane is quite extensive for modest distortions requiring a large number of feeds. The advantage of the combined approach is the reduction of the number of feeds required for www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 236 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering compensation. The DFP can focus all the energy into a small area in the focal plane. Also, by including a monopulse center feed, accurate pointing information can be obtained. Thus, such a system can provide almost compete restoration of the gain and also provide accurate pointing information to the active control system (ACS). Figure 30: Thin electronics on a Kapton substrate. 4.2 Multifunctional membranes Miniaturization, multifunctional, full-integration, low weight, and low cost are the major drivers for current and future space structures. Low cost, low launch volume, high-performance space structures may be developed by fully integrating technologies such as “system-on-chip” into the body of the deployable space membrane. In particular, polyimide films offer an outstanding opportunity for integration/packaging of multifunctional devices/chips on lightweight membranes. Today's thick silicon chips are relatively large multilayer polyimide systems. Mechanical integration and functional interfacing is of significant importance and is the foundation of many future space applications. The establishment of the related know-how and systematic study forms the basis of future research in this area. Currently, the technology has been established for reliable attachment of thin (25–35 micron) silicon chips, as well as thin chip-carrying polymer patches, to polyimide membrane (Fig. 30). Technologies of specific interest in the upcoming years in the area of multifunctional membranes will be: Advanced materials and processes for integrating membranes, electronics, sensors, actuators, power sources, and their associated interconnect into a unified and adaptable structure. Methodology and modeling techniques needed to optimize materials and process selection for integrating MEMS devices with CMOS electronics. Lightweight, distributed power systems, and active or passive thermal-control systems integrated with membrane structures. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 237 Models will be needed which optimize power-storage and thermal-management designs. Materials with controllable surface properties that, when combined with integral control electronics, could adapt to changing environmental conditions or mission needs (e.g., changing optical properties to steer a solar sail). Concepts and components for active, adaptive wavefront control systems, including shape control of membrane mirrors, with correction to < 1 wavelength. Adaptive systems for measuring and correcting surface figure and wavefront errors, and for controlling structural geometry and dynamics. Thinning processes for substrates, and bonding processes for attachment to thin films and membranes. 4.3 Smart structures One of the most important technology drivers for demonstration of the feasibility of ultra- lightweight inflatable structures is the requirement for reliably maintaining the surface precision during the mission’s life. It is impractical, if not impossible, to qualify such large lightweight systems on the ground prior to committing to flight. A basic approach to assure confidence for maintaining the desired surface accuracy on orbit includes integrating actuators and sensors into the precision surface, as well as into the support structure of the inflatable system. The sensors will then be used to evaluate the surface accuracy in orbit and to make the required adjustments, using the actuators during the mission to achieve and maintain the required precision surface. This methodology will provide project managers confidence that requirements for the precision of the surface can be achieved before committing to launching an inflatable structure as part of a space mission. The performance of inflatable optics and antennas critically depends on surface precision, which is difficult to pre-assure and is affected by service conditions. Emulating biological muscles allows control and reconfigurability of inflatable structures, while benefiting from packageability, low mass, and power. Embedding actuators in membranes addresses the critical need for shape control of inflatable structures. Recent advances in materials technology have resulted in several possible new actuator and sensors that can be placed on thin membrane material with an actuation range of up to 5%. These new actuator/sensor materials are compatible with polymer membrane materials being considered in current inflatable structures and packaging approaches. Two of the potential materials are a long-stroke piezo-polymer and a thin-film shape-memory polymer. 5 Testing and deployment 5.1 Ground testing Ground testing of any structural system may be required for the following reasons: Physical insight for mathematical model development Physical testing and experience are often necessary to develop a sense of what parameters should be included in a model. For example, an impact model might require high-speed video of an impact to determine whether rebound of the target or projectile were significant parameters. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 238 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Determination of model data Models that attempt to predict the response of real structures will require physical data about the structural system, such as material properties, loads, temperature, etc. Validation of mathematical models Every mathematical model needs a reality check. Model predictions must be compared where possible to actual physical response. Prediction beyond model capability Many physical phenomena will exist beyond the current capabilities of mathematical models, due to complexity, size, time, etc., and physical testing of actual or prototype systems is required. Specific to membrane/inflatables, the following tests are of interest: Static loading Static-load tests range from determining mechanical material properties (strength, modulus, etc.) to structural component or system response to static loads (stress, strain, deflection). These tests may be time-independent (elastic) or time-dependent (e.g., viscoelastic). Loads may be mechanical forces or thermal loads. Vibration or modal Vibration or modal tests seek to determine “modal” parameters: natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping properties. These tests may be at the component or system level. Due to the ultra low weight and flexibility of membrane/inflatables, vibrations tests must always be performed and often require use of a vacuum chamber to simulate the response in space. Surface precision Since a primary application of gossamer spacecraft is for antennas or mirrors, the characterization of their surface accuracy is important. Test methods include stereoscopic video topography for long-wavelength antennas with results given in mm rms. Optical reflector characterization may consist of Shack–Hartmann local slope measurement, with results given in waves of error. Deployment At the time of writing, deployment tests have been limited to slow deployment of structural members such as tube and struts, and planar membranes such as sunshields. Full ground deployment of a gossamer spacecraft remains elusive. Space environmental This testing is discussed further in the next section. Especially challenging with gossamer spacecraft is the unique need to make test measurements via no contact methods. Due to their extreme low weight and flexibility, contact with the test article may intolerably disturb what is to be measured. For typical membrane materials: A strain gage will be much stiffer The smallest accelerometers will be orders of magnitude more massive Thermocouple leads will be more massive and stiffer Alternatives to strain gages are optical extensometers for material testing, or optical methods such as moiré or electronic speckle interferometry for general strain measurements. Alternatives to accelerometers are laser Doppler velocimeters (laser vibrometers). Alternatives www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 239 to thermocouples include infrared thermography. Jenkins and co-workers have demonstrated the use of both laser vibrometry and infrared thermography on gossamer spacecraft. 5.2 Micrometeoroid and debris testing This testing is intended to provide data on micrometeoroid impact effects on spaced thin-film layers representative of long-life space missions. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) sunshield team proposed a comprehensive test plan for micrometeoroid and debris testing. A key issue with respect to the feasibility of the inflatable sunshield concept is the thermal- performance degradation caused by micrometeoroid impact effects. Micrometeoroid impacts can reduce sunshield thermal performance through the damage mechanisms. Three basic types of tests should be conducted on any membrane structures in particular multilayer structures designed for long life in space: Gross-failure test: These tests are for the purpose of (1) providing data on the susceptibility of spaced thin films to gross failure and (2) on the number and size of holes generated throughout the multiple film layers in the sunshield from a single particle impact. Layer-to-layer spacing and impact particle size should be varied. Multiple shots should be made at a given layer-to-layer spacing and impact particle size, to provide data on various impact velocities and to increase the size of the statistical database. Tests should be conducted at a normal-impact angle and utilize multiple square film layers per test shot. Shallow-angle test: Shots should provide a check for the development of highly elongated holes that might tear under subsequent stressing. These shots should also measure any increase in the number of particles that impact the second layer. Thick-coating test: Shots should be made at normal angle at single film layers with a coating to check for cracking, delaminating, or other impact effects that could degrade performance. 5.3 Deployment/inflation methods One of the great advantages of membrane/inflatables is their ability to be compactly packaged. That compactness is a double-edged sword, however, since it leads to additional challenges in going from the stowed to the deployed state. Deployment can either proceed as sequential or parallel, in open or closed-loop control. In sequential deployment, one event is planned to occur at the conclusion of another. Parallel deployment consists of one or more events planned to occur simultaneously. Whether or not the events occur as planned depends on a number of factors, primarily on the adequacy of factors such as engineering, design, fabrication, etc. Here, however, we concentrate on the additional factor of deployment control. Open-loop deployment control is non-feedback control. For example, in open-loop sequential control, a timer may be set to stage one event after the conclusion (with a possible delay) of another event. However, there is no feedback as to whether the previous event actually concluded, or in what state it left the system if it did conclude. The deployment of the IAE was an example of sequential open-loop control. Closed-loop control seeks to minimize an error function, given some input, some reporting of the current state of the system (the feedback), and some desired system state. Continuing the example above, under closed-loop control, a new event would not begin until it was determined www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 240 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering that the previous event had concluded, and had left the system in the desired state to begin execution of the new activity. A technique for deployment of membrane/inflatable structural members, such as tubes and struts, is under development. Three techniques currently being investigated are: Rollout method Mandrel method Fan-fold method In the rollout method, a tube is flattened and rolled out under pressure, analogous to the children’s party favor. Judiciously placed Velcro tabs provide sequential open-loop control by supplying resistance for the tube to inflate against. In the mandrel method, a z-folded tube is extruded under pressure over a tapered mandrel. The mandrel provides passive directional control for the tube, as well as friction resistance to control deployment rate. The fan-fold method is similar to the mandrel, utilizing z-folded tubes, but the internal mandrel is replaced with an external framework. Modeling of membrane/inflatable deployment is in its infancy. Modeling is hampered by the highly nonlinear deformations, displacements, and material properties encountered with membrane/inflatables. Moreover, although the initial and final deployment states may be well defined, it is likely that the intermediate states will be non-unique and non-repeatable. 6 Future directions It is expected that the focus of future work in the area of flexible structures will be on technology development for solar sails and large apertures. For large apertures the areas of specific interest are: Very large, ultra-lightweight (areal density < 1 kg/m 2) optical systems for astronomical telescopes and Earth imagers observing in the sub-millimeter/far IR, IR, visible, UV, and X-ray spectral regions. Large deployable and/or inflatable antennas for use in space-based radio astronomy, microwave radiometry, radar, and communications. Desirable performance characteristics for these systems, and in particular for near-term proof-of-concept technology and hardware development are: High packaging efficiency for small launch volume Rapid, low-cost manufacturing Design traceable to space-qualified materials Robust system response to re-pointing of aperture High surface reflectivity after repeated deployment In the solar sail area, the main objective will be to rapidly advance the readiness of key technologies so that a solar sail space flight experiment could be conducted within the next 5- 10 years. It is expected that both large apertures and solar sails will rely heavily on multifunctional and adaptive systems. The development of multifunctional and adaptive systems applicable to large, ultra-lightweight deployable or inflatable structures will be very important. To achieve breakthroughs in lowering the cost, launch volume, and mass of future missions, it will be necessary to develop highly integrated multifunctional membranes with embedded thin-film electronics, sensors, actuators, and power sources. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press Gossamer spacecraft 241 6.1 Material requirements A comprehensive membrane/inflatable material property data base, containing what we now know and how well we know it (test methods) Better interaction of material scientists with applied mechanicians, system designers, mission planners, etc. Multi-functional materials that integrate load carrying, electronics, thermal management, shielding, etc. 6.2 Analysis requirements The greatest challenge is to bridge length and time scales, from the nano- and micro- levels to structural-level response Better interaction of applied mechanicians with materials scientists, system designers, mission planners, etc. Environmental effects such as aging and degradation must be better linked to mechanical property changes, and all are incorporated into predictive models Thorough coupling of numerical and experimental analysis needs to occur 6.3 Testing and deployment requirements Deployment control Closed-loop control is essential, whether sequential or parallel. Passive techniques, such as Velcro, shape-memory materials, and friction resistance need further development. Sensors are required for state measurement. Active actuators and materials need development. Shape achievement The disadvantages with lenticular systems include the need for makeup inflatant when tears and micrometeoroid punctures occur, and the loss of information caused by the double-pass through the canopy. Non-lenticular methods for achieving service shape need to be developed, such as use of stress coatings on near-net shape membranes, and the use of precision rigidizable materials. Shape maintenance Sensors and systems to determine the current shape of large membrane/inflatables need to be developed. Considerable effort needs to be made in modeling the deployment dynamics, including employment of stochastic methods. Non-model-based algorithms, such as fuzzy-logic approaches, should be investigated. Integrated material/sensor/actuator systems are required. Damping control Since membrane/inflatables tend to have high inherent damping, we have not included a discussion of damping control here. However, configurations may exist for certain applications where damping is a significant driver, such as precision instrumentation positioned on the end of a long strut. Hence, some efforts need to be made to explore passive and active damping of such systems. www.witpress.com, ISSN 1755-8336 (on-line) WIT Transactions on State of the Art in Science and Engineering, Vol 20, © 2005 WIT Press 242 Compliant Structures in Nature and Engineering Acknowledgement The authors wish to thank NASA for permission to use all of the figures in this chapter.
